# **SimpleDraw**
## 3-D Computer Graphics, Samuel R. Buss (OpenGL 4.6)

### This is the **SimpleDraw** application used in the book **3-D Computer Graphics by Samuel R. Buss, 1st Edition published 2005.** The original OpenGL code, that is used with the book, can be found here: [SimpleDraw](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/MathCG/OpenGLsoft/SimpleDraw/SimpleDraw.html)
&nbsp;
### This is a working port of the same program to OpenGL v4.6 using the OpenGL YouTube series by **The Cherno** as a tutorial.

### Besides the excellent book, from which this code originates, special credit belongs the **The Cherno** for his excellent series:  [OpenGL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2)
